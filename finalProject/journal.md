## Final Project
### Follow the line

### 1. Idea
In my last project, I plan to develop the idea of the "follow the line" game. I started working on it as part of the project on [November 24th](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NHkftkh1YBJvv7NzOJ9rMNpQoOk1TNax/view?usp=sharing) and I think it is interesting enough to be the basis of my final project. I would like to follow the general concept, but would like to add several levels, enrich the visual aestethic and mare it a game with a clear start and end.

### 2. Sketches
