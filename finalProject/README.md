## Final Project
### Cherry-man

For my last project, I created an interactive version of Pac Man where the player adjusts the sensors instead of using the keyboard arrows. Skim through [this page](https://github.com/martapienkosz/interactivemedia/blob/master/finalProject/journal.md) to learn more about the project.

The idea of the game is that the user controls the movement of packman on the screen with two sensors. Its task is to avoid ghosts and collect cherries pleaced on the screen. Gaining a point is signified by changing the color of the LEDs from white to yellow. A collision with a ghosts turns the LED red. I used the readings from both of these sensors to control packman x position (ultrasonic sensor) and y position(potentiometer).
