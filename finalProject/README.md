## Final Project
### Check it out!

For my last project, I created an interactive version of Pac Man where the player adjusts the sensors instead of using the keyboard arrows. Skim through this page to learn more about the project. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tTu0cZ11i4OVjSsQgJ17QdALKf_O11EA/view?usp=sharing) you can find a game preview showing the interaction between Processing and Arduino. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tQZ-tte18zLt6rMmS_dTMdtvdNMafPEc/view?usp=sharing), however, you can find a video of the game.
